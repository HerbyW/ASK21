    === General Help Version 4.3===
    
     - You can take off using a winch or use another aircraft as an aerotow.
     - The winch / aerotow cable can be released with the "o" key or using button 1 of the (first) joystick.

    === Winch Takeoff Procedure ===

     - Retract speed brake
     - Set trim just forward of the middle position.
     - Press 'Ctrl-w' to place winch.
     - Press 'Shift-w' to start winch and take up cable slack.
     - When the glider starts moving, press 'Shift-w' several times to accelerate the winch
       (up to full speed).
     - Keep the wings level with the aileron and the glider going in a straight line with the rudder.
       Keep elevator centered, the glider will lift off and rotate by automatically as long as the trim is set
       correctly.
       Once the established in the climb, you can pull back on the stick slightly to increase climb rate.
     - Control the winch speed throughout the entire launch. 'Shift-w' makes the winch run faster,
       'w' makes it run slower.
       Try to maintain constant force on the cable, you will need to gradually slow down the winch
       as glider climbs.
     - When the glider reaches the top of the launch, close winch throttle to 5% and press 'o'
       to release the cable.

    === Aerotow Takeoff Procedure ===

      - Retract speed brake
      - Place another aerotow aircraft in front of your glider (multi-player).
      - Press 'Ctrl-o' to hook to the aerotow.
      - Ask the other aircraft to take off :).
      - Keep wings level and follow the aircraft until after takeoff.
      - The glider should lift off before the tug, stay close to the ground until the tug starts climbing.
      - When at appropriate alitude, press 'o' to release the cable.

    === Ground handling ===

    This aircraft has some features to help with ground handling:

      - Enable wing holder: the aircraft gets levelled around the x-axis as if
        someone was holding your wing.
      - Enable ground handling: controls are modified to help move the glider around
        on the ground:
        1. All rudder inputs will make the glider turn, as if someone was pulling on the wingtip.
        2. All throttle inputs cause the glider to taxi, as if someone (or a car) was pulling or pushing it.
      - When exceeding a given speed of 15 kts assisting gears will be reset to off (e.g. on takeoff), ground handling will become inactive at 20kts.

    When there is somebody with a follow-me around, you can connect to it by pressing Ctrl+o
    (release: Ctrl+shift+o) so he can carry you around the airport
    or even tow you into the air! (also check the Aerotow Settings therefore.
    
    
    === Change wind settings ===

Environment > Weather: Weather Conditions: Fair weather -- detailed weather -- advanced settings
Advanced weather Configuration: realistic weather, terrain presampling and terrain effects on,
Wind settings - Wind model: aloft interpol, generate thermals, realistic visability and cloud shadows on,
Convective Conditions: rough day, Turbulence: 60%, Weather Pattern Scales: both to 50%
Wind Configuration: Direction and Speed as you want to see it: for example:

230/13 220/23 210/35 190/40  (210/150  270/175  290/250  270/250 260/250)

This setting illuminates a chcanging wind from the south-west with diffrent speed in different altitudes,
so that everyone can have the same flight conditions and a lot of differnt tasks may be done!
FL00 is sea-level! Have fun!

Norway: ENBM Bomoen
France: LFHZ Mont Blanc, LFNC Saint Crepin
Austria: LOWI Innsbruck
Italia: LIDB Belluno

In the extra folder "AI" you find some towing action, copy all files into the AI folder of FGdata. Then select the ai-scenaries as usual. Used airports are: LSZR, EDFZ and SAWC
